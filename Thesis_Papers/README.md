# Intensive 7-Day Dual-Paper Plan

**Goal for this week:** make serious progress on **both papers**:

1. **Thesis paper:** multimodal sarcasm detection based on cue learning / CLIP-style multimodal modeling, with proper model development and updated experiments.
2. **Second paper:** Bangla cyberbullying detection with strong ML/DL baselines and a submission-ready first draft.

By the end of 7 days, the target is:

- working **ML/DL models** for both papers
- **first submissionable drafts** for both papers (not final, but serious)
- solid understanding of the **required topics only**

---

## Final strategy

Because your thesis teacher wants a **proper sarcasm-detection model like the one in the paper, with improvements**, this week should be split into **two active tracks every day**:

### Track A — Thesis paper (highest priority)
**Topic:** Multimodal sarcasm detection based on cue learning / CLIP-style multimodal modeling

### Track B — Second paper
**Topic:** Bangla cyberbullying detection using strong classical + transformer baselines

This is an **intensive** plan, not a light one. It assumes you can give the week fully.

# What not to do this week

Do **not** waste time on:

- advanced theory not needed for implementation
- building a huge new Bangla sarcasm dataset from scratch
- trying too many models without documenting results
- rewriting code repeatedly without saving experiments

---

# Final note

This revised plan is intentionally aggressive because you said you can fully use the week. The best use of that time is:

- **morning / first half:** thesis sarcasm model and reading
- **second half:** cyberbullying model and writing
- **night / final block:** documentation, tables, figures, and paper drafting

The thesis paper now gets **full implementation priority**, not just background reading.
